      <h1>I bridge design and tech to build better products.</h1>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a product designer who is fluent in product design and tech. As the
        UX lead in a product team, I led and advocated for best practices such
        as design research, usability testing, prototyping and accessibility. I
        believe in research and continuous testing to build great experiences to
        solve real needs. In my free time, I work on fun side projects as a way
        to learn programming and understand technology. I live with my partner
        and our two cats. My current obsessions are bullet journaling and
        watching The Real Housewives of Atlanta.
